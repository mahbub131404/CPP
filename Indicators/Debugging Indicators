Common Debugging Indicators
🔹 Compiler Errors: When your code has syntax issues (e.g., missing ;, undeclared variables).
🔹 Runtime Errors: When your code crashes while running (e.g., division by zero).
🔹 Logical Errors: When your code runs but gives wrong results.

📌 Example (Runtime Error)
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 0;
    cout << a / b; // ❌ ERROR: Division by zero!
    return 0;
}
